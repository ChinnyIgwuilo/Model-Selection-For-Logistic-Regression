# 🔍 Model Selection for Logistic Regression  

## 📌 Overview  
This project demonstrates **hyperparameter tuning and model selection** for Logistic Regression using **GridSearchCV**. The objective was to identify the best parameters to maximize performance on a binary classification task.  

---

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Implement Logistic Regression for binary classification.  
- Apply **GridSearchCV** to tune hyperparameters (`C`, `penalty`, `solver`).  
- Compare baseline vs. optimized model performance.  

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack  
- **Languages:** Python  
- **Libraries:** pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn  
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook  

---

## 📊 Results  
- **Best Parameters:** `C=1`, `penalty='l2'`, `solver='liblinear'`  
- **Accuracy:** Improved to 82% with tuned parameters.  
- Optimization confirmed that fine-tuning improved classification performance.
